## useReducer Counter App

<br>

Just a simple counter app constructed with useReducer hook to manage / change state instead of useState hook.

Advantage of useReducer in this context is that it allows the ability to manage multiple pieces of state in one place via state object, as opposed to useState where you can only change / manage one piece in the one place.

Just a practice project to re-familiarise myself with the useReducer hook.
